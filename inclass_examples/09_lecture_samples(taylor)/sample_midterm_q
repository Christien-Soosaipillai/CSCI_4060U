1.Make Critical regions as smal as possible
  why? because they are slow
2.Minimize/ optimize use of barriers
3.Avoid the ordered construct, except when needed
4.Maximize parallel regions, avoid small ones
(do as much work in parallel regions as possible)
5.Avoid parallel inner loop regions
6.Avoid uneven load balancing()
7.combine parallel loops when possible
8.why is critical faster than atomic
9.identify race condition
